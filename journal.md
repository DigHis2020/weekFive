As a music lover, I am particularly drawn to the work of Cristina Wood, who sonified the activity of the Ottawa river and quite effectively told the story of the river and its interactions with industry and the public. Not only was it effective, but it provided a unique way of presenting data that I had never really considered before. 
I was also partcularly intrigued by the work of Jeff Vietch on hearing historical settings that was made available through the Programming Historian website. 

This is why I was so taken by the TwoTone app that allowed me to do this same kind of work. I was not able to produce the same level of quality using the default data, however it really did spark an interest for me in exploring creative ways of expressing the past. 

I had a different way of interpreting the potential of sonifying. I utilized TwoTone as more of an audio aid to simple data points. It was very one dimensional, compared to the work of Wood whose work I would describe as being orchestral and arranged. If I were to repeat this exercise, I would make more of an effort to mirror the aesthetic of Wood, whose message I think was more clearly delivered than my own first try. 

In regard to the story map, I was also quite excited about the potential of this tool for my own use as a historian. The medium really inspired me because I really like maps so the joining of history onto maps is a powerful tool for me. 
I think I did a good job of selecting a story in history that made use of the mapping technology avilable. The William Wallace story jumps around the map but the app allowed the story to remain coherent. If I were to repeat this exercise, I would consider doing it on a global scale. I think this has the potential to help create new perspectives of global relations between actors in history. 

I showed these two works to my roommate. He was particularly drawn to my Story Map, which we agreed had more applications outside of just history. It was an effective way of delivering information, while making the story come alive. We both agreed that the sonification should use more complex data in order to be relevant as a communication of history. 

Virtually all of the mediums that I practised this week have added value to my historian's craft. I am considering becoming a teacher, so learning about these unique methods of presenting historical information is very exciting for me. Especially the Story Map delivers important information in a very effective way.
