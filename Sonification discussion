I chose to use the oscillator as the tone to represent the data on coin location. 
This made the most sense sonically because these are comparatively neutral tones. 
The patterns in the data can then be studied with ease. 
This seemed to be the only necessary adjustment to the settings in this specific training. 


I think it would be interesting to further explore this app using more complex data sets, or even multiple data sets overlapping one another. 
Two-tone is a fairly powerful tool for visualizing data that can then be interpreted in a way that is mostly inaccessible during a text-based analysis. 

Music is an effective tool at interpreting history because of its ability to capture emotion, and in general, it tends to move people in a unique way. 
The choice of instrument can determine in large part what meaning the sonified data will convey. 
As instruments are layered over each, they can create a very unique palette of sound which is capable of modelling historical data well.
