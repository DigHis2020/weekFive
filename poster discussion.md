How would you repurpose this poster to fit the requirements of the assessment exercise

The compartmentalized boxes provide space to put clear, standalone statements in their own box. 
This gives them their own space in the poster to occupy in a strong way. 
The colours were uniform and allowed the neutral coloured lettering to pop. 

This poster design was not ideal for adapting to my essay. 
There were too many compartments for text so there ended up being empty space. 
The geometric boxes were hard to adapt to as well. 
The initial poster featured a massive circle around which the entire poster was centered. 
This was irrelevant in my revised poster so that became the key issue throughout the process. 

I would do away with the irregualrly shaped text boxes and restart from that beginnign stage. This would benefit my design. 
I would create text boxes that depict my essay's main points in a coherent order. 
For example: title and thesis at the top, key details below etc. 
I would also redo the colours to maybe represent the country of Iran, or their revolutionary colours. Something more appropriate to the theme.
